      FeBe is a standalone facebook messenger bot that allows you to sell your
      product from your facebook page and website. FeBe is also a tool for
      marketing on Facebook. Currently, facebook messenger has 1.2 billion
      monthly active users. Most of the E-commerce companies have started
      selling their products via facebook messenger. To make the selling process
      easy and automated we have developed software that will auto-answer your
      customer's query, allow them to browse products in messenger, see the
      details of products and they can pay via Paypal and Stripe. On the other
      hand, you can see you're earning analytics, manage orders, products, and
      customers from the admin dashboard.
